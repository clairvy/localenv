Daredevil SKK is a version of SKK (Simple Kana to Kanji conversion
program, an input method of Japanese) maintained by the SKK
development team at

http://openlab.jp/skk

It consists of a simple core and many optional programs which provide
extensive features.  Though it has been well developed, our target is
more simplified core, and much more optional features.

If you want to join development of Daredevil SKK, you can access its
